## HTML TASKS
* In `trivia.html`, add beneath “Part 1” a multiple-choice trivia question of your choosing with HTML.
* You should use an h3 heading for the text of your question.
* You should have one button for each of the possible answer choices. There should be at least three answer choices, of which exactly one should be correct.
* beneath “Part 2” add a text-based free response question of your choosing with HTML.
* You should use an h3 heading for the text of your question.
* You should use an input field to let the user type a response.
* You should use a button to let the user confirm their answer.

## JAVASCRIPT  TASKS
* Add logic so that the buttons change colors when a user clicks on them.
  * If a user clicks on a button with an incorrect answer, the button should turn red and text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”.
  * If a user clicks on a button with the correct answer, the button should turn green and text should appear beneath the question that says “Correct!”.
* add logic so that the text field changes color when a user confirms their answer.
    * If the user types an incorrect answer and presses the confirmation button, the text field should turn red and text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”.
    * If the user types the correct answer and presses the confirmation button, the input field should turn green and text should appear beneath the question that says “Correct!”.
